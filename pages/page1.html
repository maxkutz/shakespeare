    <h1>Early Life</h1>
    <p>William Shakespeare was born around April 26, 1564 in Stratford, Warwickshire, England.
    Shakespeare grew up there in a family with 5 other siblings, and attended school there as well. Before the age of 20, his mastery of writing and the art of creating plays was on full display, having had at least 18 plays commisioned by the town council.(This was often a requirement for being able to publically perform a play in the era.)</p>
