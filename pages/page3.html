    <h1>Others of His Era</h1>
    <p>In Shakespeare's time, there were other great writers as well. This includes such authors like Chrisopher Marlowe, a friend of Shakespeares that may have wworked with him on 4 of his earlier plays, who is considered one of the most important and influential tragedy writers of all time. Another major influence emerging from the time was the collaborations of Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher, which became some of the earliest and largest forms of satire and tragic comedies.</p>
